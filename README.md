# Heart Collectors' Extension
*Why type out a â™¥ and press "Comment" when Chrome can do that for you?**

## Install. How do?

Download the CRX on the Download page, or clone this repository and "Load an unpacked extension" at chrome://extensions/. If Chrome is freaking out about downloading from unknown sources, follow [these](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769) steps. If there's enough demand, I'll put this on the Chrome Web Store soon.

## Use. How do?

Go to a valid profile that you have commenting rights on and press the magical heart button by the bookmark icon.

## Contribute. How do?

1. Fork
2. Create a new branch.
3. Codecodecode
4. Use LF line endings.
5. Submit a pull request.
6. Praise the almighty sun gods.
7. ??
8. Profit!
